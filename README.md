# Last Epoch Offline Character Generator

This is a tool to create an offline character save file.  This tool allows you to generate a character at level 1, or level 100.  With no endgame content completed, or banging down the doors of uber aberroth.  Do it as a hardcore character, or a solo self-found character, or both!

Why?  Well simply put, after grinding to 100 once, why do it again?  Its agonizing work already and not a lot of people have the time or patience for it.  Also, perhaps you want to try different classes and specs at end-game and see if you'll enjoy the play.  Theres a plethera of reasons for this and thanks to Last Epoch having am offline mode you can do what you want.  

No, there is no anti-cheat.  Its OFFLINE!  It's as it should be.
